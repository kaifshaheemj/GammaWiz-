# GammaWiz: Gamma Signal Classification Project

GammaWiz is a project designed for the classification of gamma signals from space using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm. The project focuses on analyzing data from the magic gamma telescope to categorize signals as either gamma or non-gamma.

## Project Structure

- **dataset/:** This directory contains the magic gamma telescope data used for training and testing the KNN model.

- **models/:** In this folder, you'll find the trained KNN models for gamma signal classification.

- **static/:** Contains static files for the web application (if applicable).

- **templates/:** Holds HTML templates for the web application (if applicable).

- **ML_CA_3.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook script for developing and training the KNN model.

- **app.py:** The main file for the web application (if applicable).

- **knn_model.py:** Python script containing the KNN model implementation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaifshaheemj/GammaWiz-.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd GammaWiz

3. Explore the Jupyter notebook for insights into model development:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook ML_CA_3.ipynb

4. Run the application (if applicable):

    ```bash
    python app.py

Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser to interact with the gamma signal classification interface.

## Usage
Use the trained KNN model to classify signals as gamma or non-gamma.
